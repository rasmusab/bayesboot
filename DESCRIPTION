Description: Functions for performing the Bayesian bootstrap as introduced by
    Rubin (1981) <doi:10.1214/aos/1176345338> and for summarizing the result.
    The implementation can handle both summary statistics that works on a
    weighted version of the data and summary statistics that works on a
    resampled data set.
